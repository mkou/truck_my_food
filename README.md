# Truck My Food! 

**Subject:**
Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map.
The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Food

## Objective

## How I did it
### Backend
#### Technologies and Libraries
**Ruby**: <br>
_2+ years of experience_ -
No need for presnetation :)
<br>
**Grape Framework**: <br>
_First use_ -
REST-like API micro-framework for Ruby. [See their GitHub](https://github.com/intridea/grape)<br/>
Light and perfect for the job
<br>
**Elasticsearch**<br>
_1,5 years_  - 
As the application does not need real time data, I decided to store the fetched data from DataSF to elasticsearch.
In my app, elasticsearch is a store and a cache. The data is updated every night.
<br>
**Ruby Gems**
- rack: Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby
- grape-swagger: provides an autogenerated documentation for your Grape API
- rake: Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby
- elasticsearch-persistence : Persistence layer for Ruby domain objects in Elasticsearch, using the Repository and ActiveRecord patterns
- bonsai-elasticsearch-rails : Elasticsearch on production to 
- racksh : console for Rack based ruby web applications.
- rspec : Test Ruby
- rack-test : require: 'rack/test'
- webmock : stubbing and setting expectations on HTTP requests in Ruby
<br>
**Heroku**<br>
Hosted on Heroku with basic settings<br>
**Heroku add-ons**
- Heroku scheduler - to schedule the store update
- Bonsai Elasticsearch
- Papertail - For logs
